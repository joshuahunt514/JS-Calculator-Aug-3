- Aug 3rd - Easy Saturday project
    - Calculator from https://zellwk.com (found off freecodecamp but let's support the smaller business)
        - Code by Zell Liew

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Finished the HTML/CSS, onwards to the JS!

- Working on the JS. 
    - button output to console.log() is working!

- This is a good guide because it is also showing me the logic behind the choices of the user of the calculator
    - User will always hit a number after an operator
    - User will hit a number after a decimal
    - Stuff like that

- Done Part 1!
